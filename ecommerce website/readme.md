**discription** --> Usually, when people want to buy something, they feel happy or excited about it and we want that feeling to stay throughout the whole experience of using the app. What I saw happening a lot during the research phase, is that people were super excited about buying something either for themselves or as a gift to a friend or family member but a few minutes using a shopping app and that feeling was shifted to uncertainty and frustration. Either because there was way too much information directly displayed, distracting and confusing the user or what was supposed to be a quick-shop turns into an eternal searching. just to wrap all these i just created a simple ui design in which the interface have the button lets go and you will continue the sign in process after that we create your account , create your style , select dress whichever we want then filter price , colour , size etc . then we have notification page in app, we can edit save our profile and history , payment . after help page for information and customer service .
**My inspiration for choosing this project** is that I learned the web in summer boot camp and made a portfolio website and shopping app, Figma, and many more. I have an interest in these and love to make Figma designs luckily I have been awarded as a top performer in Webd bootcamp, so I have gained more confidence in it .
**My motive for choosing this colour theme** is to make things visible and keep things simple, as light colour is an inspiration of alertness, wisdom and clarity.
